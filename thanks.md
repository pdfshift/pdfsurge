# Thanks!

[PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/) was the library that decided us to make PDFSurge.

Two main reasons about it was:

 1 - The library is not maintenaned anymore. [A thread was started about restarting it](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/issues/385) but - as the time of the writing - was never really put in motion
 2 - The approach. Having to handle a reader + a writer to update a document seemed over complicated.

But it's also thanks to PyPDF2 that we were able to dive deep into PDF reading from Python.
I think it's a really efficient library that approach reading in an interesting maner.

I did took a few ideas into PDFSurge, changing how the developer interact with the core.

But PyPDF2 is not the only _Python_ library, these libraries where also helpful in the making of PDFSurge:
